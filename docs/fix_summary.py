print("üîß LAUNCHER METHOD SWITCHING - FIX SUMMARY")
print("=" * 60)

print("\n‚ùå PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ The launcher GUI had a mountain generation method dropdown")
print("   ‚Ä¢ But changing between 'simple' and 'geological' had no effect")
print("   ‚Ä¢ The terrain always looked the same regardless of selection")

print("\nüîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ ui_generator.py was hardcoded to use create_complex_mountain_cv2()")
print("   ‚Ä¢ It ignored the 'mountain_generation_method' config setting")
print("   ‚Ä¢ The method selection was stored but never actually used")

print("\nüõ†Ô∏è  SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Modified ui_generator.py to check mountain_generation_method config")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added conditional logic to choose between:")
print("     - create_simple_mountain_cv2() for 'simple' method")
print("     - create_complex_mountain_cv2() for 'geological' method")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added debug message showing which method is being used")

print("\n‚úÖ VERIFICATION RESULTS:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Test script confirms methods produce different terrain")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Mean difference: 0.124804 elevation units")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Max difference: 0.906742 elevation units")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Visual comparison saved as 'method_comparison.png'")

print("\nüéØ WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ 'Simple' method: Original mathematical mountain shapes")
print("     - Faster generation")
print("     - Clean, geometric mountain forms")
print("     - Good for stylized or game-like terrains")
print("   ")
print("   ‚Ä¢ 'Geological' method: Realistic terrain with curved mountains")
print("     - Natural curved boundaries (no straight lines)")
print("     - Prominent ridge and valley systems")
print("     - Complex geological processes simulated")
print("     - More realistic and organic appearance")

print("\nüöÄ NOW WORKING:")
print("   ‚úÖ Dropdown selection in launcher GUI is functional")
print("   ‚úÖ Method switching produces visibly different results")
print("   ‚úÖ Both simple and geological methods work correctly")
print("   ‚úÖ Configuration is properly passed to generation engine")

print(f"\n{'=' * 60}")
print("üéâ Mountain generation method switching is now FULLY FUNCTIONAL!")
print("   Try both methods in the launcher to see the difference!")
